*
*        The directory tree in HTML format is represented as a set of
*        nested unordered lists.  The data associated with any <li> tag
*        is contained in an HTML table having 1 row and 3 columns:
*        an image, directory name, and directory size equal to the
*        sum of the sizes of all its contained files, plus the sum of
*        the sizes of all its subdirectories.
*        Each <ul> tag is associated with a directory which
*        contains subdirectories, and its first child <li> tag displays
*        the data for that directory; succeeding child <li> tags
*        correspond to 'leaf' subdirectories, that is, subdirectories
*        not having subdirecories of their own, followed by subdirectories
*        of the original parent directory which do have subdirectories.

=head1 USAGE

    dirtree_dos.pl <path of root of desired subtree>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The output of this program is an HTML file which displays the hard disk
usage of all the directories of interest, as a collapsible tree;
this display is supported by most modern browsers.  A filter is available
to constrain files by SIZE and AGE.

=head1 CLOSURES

=head2 walkTree

Data is stored in a hash for every path in the directory tree as it is
navigated by 'walkTree'.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=head2 filter

The anonymous subroutine, 'filter', determines the admissibility of files
according to the values assigned to the constants SIZE and AGE, both having
a default value of 0. (Although it is considered bad programming practice to
edit source code to set a value, in this instance it really is much simpler to
adjust comments, i.e. pound signs, appropriately...mea culpa).

=head2 writeHTML

The 'writeHTML' function writes the output file in html format for
display as a collapsible directory tree in most modern browsers.

=head2 recur

This routine writes out HTML code for each path in the tree recursively
as an item in a nested set of unordered lists.

=head2 leafsort

For a given directory, 'leafsort' returns an array with all leaves listed
before all subdirectories containing additional subdirectories of their
own.

=head2 leafcount

A count of the total number of leaves in the tree is returned by 'leafcount'.


=cut
