**_dirtree_** contains two analogous _perl_ scripts, one for _unix_-like systems, **_dirtree_unix.pl_**,
and the other, **_dirtree_dos.pl_**, for _windows_.  When viewed in a browser, an
_html_ file created by running the appropriate *perl* script for the underlying operating
system, displays a
**collapsible tree** of subdirectories, with associated sizes, for manipulation by the user
to easily visualize disc usage.  The basic unit displayed is a subdirectory, not a file!  Generated _html_ files are supported by plain vanilla *javascript* and *css*.
