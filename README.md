**_dirtree_** contains two analogous _perl_ scripts, one for _unix_-like systems, **_dirtree_unix.pl_**,
and the other, **_dirtree_dos.pl_**, for _windows_.  When run from the command line,
each script creates an _html_ file displaying a
**collapsible tree** of subdirectories, with associated sizes, for manipulation by the user
to easily visualize disc usage.  Generated _html_ files are supported by plain vanilla *javascript* and *css*.
